# Ceresio
Ceresio is a hybrid android app developed in Ionic Framework. It scans the barcodes and uses AR to overlay your screen with helpful information about how to dispose or recycle garbage. (It was created as an exploration of Ionic Framework, and is not meant to be actually functional. Feel free to read through the [wiki](https://github.com/Celina-W/Ceresio/wiki) for more info.)
